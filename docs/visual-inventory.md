# V3 Reference And Evidence Inventory

This older inventory is historical. The approved canonical reference is
[AA3.5.2 source-to-concern map](visual-reference-map.md), not the AA3.5.0 snapshot
below. Fresh artifacts use the [durable evidence manifest](evidence-inventory.md).
Historical gate statuses below are not current-head verification results.

Historical source: [AA3.5.0 variables](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/v3.5.0/app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin/mixins/_variables.scss),
inspected September 12, 2026. This is tagged-source evidence, not a historical
screenshot. No mutable online demo is labeled AA3.5 here.

| Role | Tagged AA3.5 source | V3 target decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Body text | `#323537` | Preserve in light mode |
| Link | `#38678b` | Preserve in light mode |
| Selected table | `#d9e4ec` | Reuse for selected controls/rows |
| Error | `#932419` | Preserve, pair with text and pale surface |
| Page gutter | 30px | 1.875rem desktop, reduced on narrow screens |
| Table padding | 5px 10px 3px 10px | Proposed symmetric compact padding, not a historical measurement |
| Sidebar width | 270px | Preserve AA4 responsive behavior; do not copy the AA3 layout |
| Text size / control height | Not established by this source | Proposed 14px / 36px, 44px for coarse pointers |
| Focus / dark mode | Not established by this source | New semantic palette and visible focus treatment |

The separately developed local host is AA4.0.0.beta22 / Rails8.1.3.1 / Tailwind4.3.3.
Its baseline uses the native AA4 plugin and server-rendered hooks. The target
is a compact, readable adaptation, not a pixel-identical port. Token values
remain proposals until visual review; color contrast and keyboard operation
must be evaluated separately from historical resemblance.

## Evidence Gates

- Unit: full RSpec suite, 100% library line/branch coverage; semantic palette
  tests require 4.5:1 for selected text/feedback pairs and 3:1 for control boundaries.
- Package/request: built-gem extraction, explicit install/repeat proof and
  synthetic-host request checks are in a separate host branch, not this PR.
- Browser/visual: pending durable login/dashboard/index/show/new/edit, empty,
  validation and long-content states at 1440, 1024, 768 and 390px; native menu,
  filters, sorting, scopes, pagination, batch, nested forms and dark persistence.
- Accessibility: pending keyboard, zoom, reduced motion, forced colors and
  contrast checks; no WCAG conformance claim.
- Delivery: host workflow publishing requires a credential-scope change;
  Showcase demonstration and separately reviewed Rodeo adoption not complete.
